AdvancedMemoryChallenges
========================

Advanced buffer overflow and memory corruption challenges.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install gcc 4.8 or above
2. Run the command "make" in the main project directory
3. Try to get each program to pop a shell (or change the control flow to your advantage in some way) 
without modifying the source code. You can try to execute some shell code, but that's the old boring 
way to do things. Look for something else.
4. Profit?
